## Changes in Titanium 1.0.0-alpha1

Initial release. The following features are reasonably well supported:

 * Essential graph operations (open, close), configuration via Clojure maps
 * Blueprints API operations on vertices and edges
 * Blueprints queries
 * Essential GremlinPipeline operations with a nice Clojure DSL

Which makes Titanium useful for prototype development. Initial documentation
will be written before `1.0.0-alpha1` is announced.
